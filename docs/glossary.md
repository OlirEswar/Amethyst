# Glossary

## General Terminology
**Pomodoro Technique**: Time management method based on
25-minute stretches of work (known as pomodoros),
broken up by 5-minute breaks.

**Pomodoro**: A 25-minute period of time when one focuses
on only working on a specific task.

**Breaks**: A 5-minute stretch of time when a specific game
is played to entertain the user as a reward for working for
an entire Pomodoro.

**Match-3 Game**: A game that consists of a 2D square board of objects
that can be matched with other similar objects in rows or columns of a length of
3 or more. Points are awarded per match and progress
a level.

**Minesweeper**: A game that consists of a 2D rectangular board with tiles that 
either have a mine, or have mines next to them. The player wins by using numbers on 
non-mined tiles to deduce where the mines actually are. Upon clicking a mine, 
the player loses.

## Match-3 Terminology
**Gem**: An object that can be matched with other objects 
of the same color, which makes up the main board. 

**Match**: A column or row of 3 or more gems of the same 
color, which forms after swapping two gems and provides 
the user with points. 

**Board**: The main playing field of the app, where users 
may interact with the game. Users can swap gems between 
two different positions on the board to make matches, and 
the cleared gems will make empty spaces, allowing gems 
from above (and newly generated gems) to fall from the 
top.

**Level**: A section of the game where the user must complete 
enough matches to generate enough points to advance to the 
next level. Upon increasing the level, a level up animation 
plays and the environment/ambience of the game changes.

**Combo**: The multiplier to points that are generated when a user 
matches gems. A user may increase their combo by making subsequent 
valid moves, i.e. 3plus-in-a-row matches that clear gems.

## Minesweeper Terminology
**Tile**: A space on the board that may or may not have a mine 
underneath. If it doesn't have a mine, a number will be shown with 
the amount of mines that are near it in a 1-tile radius.

**Mine**: The object to avoid in Minesweeper. Upon clicking a tile 
that has one, the board will explode, and the game will end.

**Board**: The main playing field of the app, where users
may interact with the game. Users may press on various tiles 
on the board in order to discover if they have mines underneath 
them or not, using logical deduction and environmental clues to 
determine which tiles have mines and which tiles don't have mines.

**Flag**: An indicator to put on top of a tile that a player thinks 
has a mine underneath. This makes it impossible to accidentally click 
tiles that the player thinks has mines underneath.
